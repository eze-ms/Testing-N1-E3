# ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Demonstration

## 📄 Description
This Java project demonstrates the intentional triggering of an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The program includes a method that accesses an invalid index in an array, throwing the exception. A JUnit 5 test is provided to validate the correct behavior and exception handling.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
   - Trigger an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` by accessing an invalid array index.
   - Handle the exception gracefully with a `try-catch` block.
   - Verify the behavior with a comprehensive JUnit 5 test.

2. **Robust Design:**
   - Ensures proper exception handling for learning purposes.
   - Validates expected behavior through automated testing.
   - Provides clear console output for exception details.
